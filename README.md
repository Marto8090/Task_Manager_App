## Task Manager (Node.js)

A small task manager I’m building this semester to practice JavaScript, Node.js, and Express — and to make something my mom (an accountant) can actually use instead of sticky notes.

Live URL: (if deployed) -

Status: Sprint 1 / 5 • Last updated: 

## What this does (MVP)

• Create, edit, delete tasks

• Status: TODO / IN_PROGRESS / DONE

• Priority: High / Medium / Low

• Due dates and simple filters

• (Later) Login so each user sees their own tasks
